# chatty-whispers

Create the basic structure for a chat app with the following pages and components:

1. Login page 
- Simple form with username/email and password fields
- "Sign In" button
- "Create Account" link

2. Registration page
- Form with fields for name, username/email, password
- "Create Account" button

3. Main chat page, with:
- Sidebar showing user's profile pic + name, a search bar, and list of contacts 
- Main content area for showing the currently open chat
- For now, just hardcode 2-3 contacts and show dummy messages if a contact is clicked

4. Chat UI
- Show user profile pic and name at top 
- List of messages (for now just show 4-5 hardcoded messages)
- Input field at bottom for typing a message 
- "Send" button next to message input

You can use a similar visual style as WhatsApp, but no need to completely copy their UI. The focus at this stage is on the main UI structure and flow between pages.
